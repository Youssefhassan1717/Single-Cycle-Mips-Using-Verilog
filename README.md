# Single-Cycle-Mips-Using-Verilog
This repository contains a Single Cycle MIPS processor implemented using Vivado. The MIPS processor is a simplified version that supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA). It is implemented as a single-cycle processor, meaning that each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
